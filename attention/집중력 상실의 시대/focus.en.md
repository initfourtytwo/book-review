## Purpose

Lately, I’ve been losing focus.
Whether I’m working, studying, or even putting my baby to sleep,
I keep catching myself unlocking my phone,
checking messages, scrolling through SNS, and switching apps for no reason.

It’s like I can’t stay deeply engaged in anything anymore.
I wasn’t sure if this was just a bad habit or a sign that I’ve been living the wrong way.
So I picked up this book to learn how to **bring my attention back to the present moment**.

## Key Concepts

* **Focusing on the present is the most efficient way to live**
  
  Not for future success or productivity — but simply to be fully immersed in what’s in front of me.

* **The myth of multitasking**
  
  We think doing multiple things at once makes us productive,
  but even a 2–3-second interruption can significantly lower accuracy and focus.

* **Information overload + negativity bias**
  
  We constantly seek information out of anxiety,
  but most of what we worry about never happens — and the process itself drains our focus.

* **Managing anxiety**
  
  Writing things down, changing your physical environment,
  or even simple body movements like *tapping* can help reset emotions.

* **Quadrant II (Important but not urgent)**

  |                   | **Urgent**                                                                                                                                                                      | **Not Urgent**                                                                                                                                              |
  | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Important**     | **Quadrant I**<br>- Crises, disasters, accidents, illness<br>- Tasks with approaching deadlines<br>- Handling complaints<br>- Preparing for meetings you lead                   | **Quadrant II**<br>- Building relationships<br>- Preventive actions<br>- Self-development and improvement<br>- Preparation and planning<br>- Proper rest    |
  | **Not Important** | **Quadrant III**<br>- Responding to trivial calls or messages<br>- Unexpected visitors<br>- Excessive meetings<br>- Meaningless socializing or networking<br>- Numerous reports | **Quadrant IV**<br>- Wasting time<br>- Taking unnecessarily long breaks<br>- Pointless long phone calls<br>- Idle chatter<br>- Other meaningless activities |

  Relationships, learning, rest, and preparation — neglecting these leads to losing what truly matters.

* **If–Then planning**
  
  “If I lose focus, then I’ll stretch for 5 minutes.”
  Simple but powerful for building habits.

* **Meaning creates happiness**
  
  It’s not outcomes but *meaning* that fuels deep engagement and satisfaction.

## Takeaway

What I realized while reading this book is that my lack of focus isn’t laziness —
it’s **anxiety disguised as productivity**.
That fear of “missing out” keeps me checking, comparing, and scattering my attention.

So here’s how I’m trying to change:

1. **Morning Routine (10 min)**

   * Write down just **three key tasks** for the day.
   * Make sure one of them is from **Quadrant II** — important but not urgent —
     and lock it into my calendar.
   * Turn on *Do Not Disturb* mode.

2. **During Work**

   * One task at a time.
   * 25-minute single-task timer → 5-minute break.
   * Say out loud: “**Don’t postpone — just do it for 5 minutes.**”

3. **If–Then Habit Cards (posted on my monitor)**

   * If focus breaks → get up and stretch for 5 minutes.
   * If I pick up my phone → put it down and take three deep breaths.
   * If I get stuck → restart with the easiest sub-task.

4. **Energy Management in Relationships**

   * Keep in touch with people who lift my energy.
   * Gently distance myself from those who drain it.
   * Using polite tone or formality can be a healthy boundary.

5. **Night Routine (5 min)**

   * Write down one thing I did well and one moment I truly focused on.
   * Tell myself, *that’s enough for today*.
